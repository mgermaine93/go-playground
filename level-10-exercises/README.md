# Channels Notes

- Channels are a higher-level way of synchronizing your code/writing concurrent code.
- Channels allow us to pass values between Goroutines.
  - The values are passed/received at the SAME TIME.
- It is important to know that CHANNELS BLOCK.
- "Buffered Channels" will only hold so many values before they block.
- "Bidirectional Channels" are channels that can both send information and receive information.
- "Range Loops" will "hang out" until the channel is closed.
  - They enable you to RANGE OVER a CHANNEL.
  - Range clauses, however, will also block, until the channel is closed.
- Using Channels
  - In functions, you can specify the following:
    - Receive Channel
      - You can receive values from the channel
      - A receive channel parameter
      - In the function, you can only pull values from the channel
      - You can't close a receive channel
    - Send Channel
      - You can push values to the channel
      - You can't receive/pull/read from the channel
      - You can only push values to the channel
- SELECT statements will pull values off of multiple channels when needed
- The "comma-OK" idiom can be used to check whether or not a channel is closed
- Fan Out/Fan In is another common design pattern
  - "Fan In" takes values from many channels and puts those values onto a single channel.
  - "Fan Out" takes some work and puts the chunks of work onto many GoRoutines
